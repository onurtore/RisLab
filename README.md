# Explanation

Testbed application implementati on Marie Sklodowska-Curie actions Co-circulation project.

Integrate  a controller algorithm which uses path finding algorithms to track predefined path.

Pre-existing code uses two haptic device to control rigid body,now one of the haptic devices disabled and uses controller algorithm to move rigid body.
