# Robotics Laboratory - Controller Project

Integrate  a controller algorithm which uses path finding algorithms to track predefined path.

Pre-existing code uses two haptic device to control rigid body,now one of the haptic devices disabled and uses controller algorithm to move rigid body.

# Getting Started

Code has 3 different parts which are: 

1)Calculate the path that rigid body will follow using combination of potantielfield, and wavefront algorithms.

2)Calculate force and torque to stay on the path.

3)Calculate feedback force for haptic devices.
